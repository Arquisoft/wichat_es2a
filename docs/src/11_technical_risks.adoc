== Risks and Technical Debts

The "Technical Risks and Debts" section outlines potential challenges and issues that may emerge during the project's development and maintenance. 
These risks and debts must be carefully assessed and addressed to ensure the project's successful completion and long-term sustainability. 
The subsections below detail both internal and external technical risks, along with the technical debts to consider.

=== Technical risks

A technical risk is defined as a potential event that could jeopardize the project's successful completion, cause delays, increase costs, or even result in failure if not effectively managed. The subsections below outline the internal and external technical risks identified for the project.

|===
| Description | Priority |  Considerations

| Lack of experience with the base project and its technologies
| 9
| Since none of the team members have prior experience with the technologies used in this project, there will be a steep learning curve. This will require extensive research and testing, which could slow down progress. However, leveraging documentation and online resources will help mitigate this risk.

| First time working as a large team on a software project
| 8
| The team has experience in GitHub but has not collaborated in such a large group before. This could lead to difficulties in task distribution, communication, and version control conflicts. Establishing clear workflows and communication channels will be essential to mitigate these issues.

| Integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) chat system
| 7
| Adding an AI-driven chat system for user hints introduces complexities such as model selection, API integration, and performance optimization. Ensuring precision in the chat responses will require careful planning.

| Managing dependencies and service configurations
| 6
| The project relies on multiple external services and dependencies, which may introduce compatibility issues. Keeping dependencies up-to-date and using containerization tools can help manage these risks.

| Unequal distribution of workload
| 5
| If tasks are not evenly distributed among team members, it may lead to burnout or bottlenecks. Regular meetings and tracking progress using project management tools will be necessary to balance workload effectively.

==== External

[options="header",cols="1,3,3"]

| Description | Priority |  Considerations

| Dependency on third-party AI API services
| 8
| The integration of an LLM chat system relies on external AI APIs, which could be subject to service limitations, or outages. Exploring fallback options or alternative providers is advisable.

| Wikidata API failure
| 3
| Even though an API failure is possible, it's a low-impact event because we have the questions stored in the database, and the game would still function.

| Cloud service downtime
| 6
| The project may rely on cloud-based infrastructure, and any downtime could affect system availability. Using monitoring tools and backup strategies can help mitigate this risk.

=== Technical debts

| Description | Priority | Considerations

| Microservices deployment limitations
| 8
| Despite the project's adoption of a microservices architecture, the current deployment setup lacks proper load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities. This creates a significant bottleneck when handling increased user traffic, particularly during peak usage times. Performance degradation becomes noticeable even with moderate user loads, making the application unsuitable for production environments without these enhancements. Implementation of container orchestration with Kubernetes or advanced Docker Swarm configurations would be necessary to fully leverage the microservices architecture's scalability benefits.

| Code reuse issues and structural patterns duplication
| 7
| Significant code duplication exists across microservices in the form of identical utility functions (validateRequiredFields, MongoDB connection setup) implemented independently in each service. This undermines the modularity benefits of the microservices architecture and creates maintenance challenges when common functionality needs to be updated. Additionally, error handling patterns are inconsistent across services, with varying approaches to validation and error responses. Similar test setup code is also duplicated across test files, with each service reimplementing MongoDB memory server configuration. A systematic refactoring effort to extract common utilities into shared libraries, standardize error handling patterns, and create reusable test fixtures would significantly reduce maintenance complexity and improve code quality.

| Wikidata API performance limitations
| 6
| The Wikidata service experiences performance issues, particularly with slow response times when fetching questions. This affects the game experience as users may experience delays while waiting for questions to load. Performance optimizations, caching mechanisms, and potentially preloading questions are required to improve user experience.

| LLM service scalability constraints
| 8
| The current LLM service implementation can only handle approximately 3 simultaneous connections and has token limitations due to using a personal-use API key. This severely restricts the scalability of the application in a production environment with multiple users. A production-ready API key with higher rate limits or implementing a queuing system would be necessary to scale the application.

| Limited internationalization
| 5
| The question system currently only supports English or Spanish, limiting the accessibility for the people which can speak neither languages.

| Lack of robust error handling
| 6
| Many API endpoints have basic error handling that returns generic error messages rather than providing specific information to help diagnose issues. This makes troubleshooting more difficult, especially in production environments. More comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging would improve system reliability and maintenance.

| Environment variable management
| 4
| The project relies on numerous environment variables for configuration with inconsistent handling across services. This creates potential for configuration errors and complicates deployment. A standardized approach to environment variable management and validation would improve system reliability.
