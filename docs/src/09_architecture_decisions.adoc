== Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

=== Inherited ADRs
Since we start from an initial project that is already functional and that we will be expanding, many architectural decisions have been inherited from it. These can be consulted in the https://github.com/Arquisoft/wiq_es05b/wiki/ADRS[wiki of the base project].

=== ADR 01: Mistral 7B as LLM Service
*_Date: 2025-02-17_*

image::MistralAI.png["Mistral", align="center"]

==== Status
[.red]#Deprecated. See <<ADR-04>>.#

==== Context
The LLM is the main feature added to the system, and is responsible for generating the hints the user will have available during each game in relation to the questions asked. An LLM service is required to provide the necessary functionality, and Mistral 7B, LLM developed by Mistral AI, shows the following aspects to consider as a potential candidate:

* Efficiency in Size and Performance: Mistral 7B is a relatively smaller model compared to others, but still provides strong performance (and even faster response times) in Natural Language Processing tasks, which makes it more manageable and a perfect choice for our system, given its requirements.
* Open-Source Model: Mistral 7B is an open-source model, which allows us to access, modify and use it freely, without any licensing issues or commercial restrictions.
* Not ideal for complex tasks: Its smaller size makes it less capable of capturing long or highly complex contexts as well as larger models, but our system does not require such complexity.
* Fine-Tuning Required: The model may require fine-tuning for the specific aspects of our application.

==== Decision
The Mistral 7B LLM Service will be used as the LLM service for the system.

[.red]#Deprecated. See <<ADR-04>>.#

==== Consequences
Mistral 7B will be implemented in our application as the external LLM hint generator.

=== ADR 02: Gitflow vs Trunk-Based Development
*_Date: 2025-02-17_*

image::GITFLOWvsTBD.jpg["Mistral", align="center"]

==== Status
Accepted.

==== Context
We need to establish a way to work as a team using Git, and determine the use to be made of branches. Among all possible approaches, two stand out: Gitflow and Trunk-Based Development.

Gitflow uses branches such as master, develop and feature, being more suitable for large projects and long cycles, with less frequent integration. Trunk-Based Development focuses on integrating changes quickly into a single main branch, promoting continuous delivery and reducing conflicts, making it ideal for agile teams and fast cycles. Gitflow is more structured, while TBD is more agile and simple. 

==== Decision
TBD chosen as our git strategy for the project.

==== Consequences
The chosen option will be the way to work from now on in the project (TBD).

=== ADR 03: Use of Neobrutalism components
*_Date: 2025-03-03_*

image::neobrutalism.png["Neobrutalism Components", align="center"]

==== Status
Declined.

==== Context
React components are essentially the building blocks of a React application. They are the visual elements that make up the user interface of the application. https://www.neobrutalism.dev/[Neobrutalism] components are a collection of neobrutalism-styled React Tailwind components. They are a mix of regular brutalism in web design and more modern typography, illustration, and animation standards.

As part of our design decisions, we need to decide whether to use Neobrutalism components in our project.

==== Decision
Decision declined.

==== Consequences
Neobrutalism components will not be used in our project.

=== ADR 04: Gemini 1.5 Flash as LLM Service
*_Date: 2025-03-10_*

image::gemini.png["Gemini", align="center"]

==== Status
Accepted.

==== Context
Gemini 1.5 Flash is a variant of Google's Gemini 1.5 AI model, designed to be lighter and faster. It is a model that has been optimized for speed and efficiency, making it ideal for applications that require quick responses and low latency.

As we've encountered some performance issues with Mistral 7B, we need to consider other LLM services that can provide the necessary functionality, and Gemini 1.5 Flash stands as the main candidate.

==== Decision
Decision accepted.

==== Consequences
Gemini 1.5 Flash substitutes Mistral 7B as the chosen LLM service for our system.

=== ADR 05: DiceBear Avatar Library
*_Date: 2025-04-20_*

image::DiceBear.png["DiceBear", align="center"]

==== Status
Accepted.

==== Context
DiceBear is a JavaScript library that allows you to create unique avatars for your applications in no time. It provides a wide range of customizable avatars, which can be generated on the fly. This library is particularly useful for applications that require user avatars, as it allows for easy integration and customization.

As we wanted our users to be able to create their own avatars, and not use a default one, we needed to find a library that would allow us to do so. DiceBear is a good candidate for this purpose, and will enhance the user experience giving the application a more personalized touch.

==== Decision
Decision accepted.

==== Consequences
DiceBear will be used in our project to allow users to create their own avatars.

[[ADR-06]]
=== ADR 06: App Deployed in ARM Oracle VM
*_Date: 2025-04-06_*

image::oracle.jpg["Oracle", align="center"]

==== Status
Accepted.

==== Context
The application deployment requires a robust, scalable, and cost-effective platform to meet quality standards. Oracle offers the possibility of deploying the application for free in a basic ARM Virtual Machine (VM), which is a good option for our needs.

==== Decision
Decision accepted.

==== Consequences
A Oracle ARM VM will be used for the deployment of the application.

=== ADR 07: Start from Scratch vs Use Previous Project
*_Date: 2025-03-10_*

==== Status
Accepted.

==== Context
Although initially we considered the possibility of using a previous project as a base for our development, we finally decided to start from scratch. We believe that starting from scratch will allow us to have a cleaner and more maintainable codebase, and to implement functionalities faster, as we'll be more familiar with our own code. It will also allow us to define our own architecture and design decisions, without being constrained by the decisions made in the previous project.

However, we will still be able to use the previous project as a reference for some functionalities and design decisions, and we will also be able to use some of the code from the previous project if we find it useful.

In that sense, some ADRs (not all of them) from the previous project will be inherited:

- JavaScript
- Microservice Architecture
- Docker
- React
- MongoDB
- ExpressJS

These can be deeply consulted in the https://github.com/Arquisoft/wiq_es05b/wiki/ADRS[previous project's wiki].

==== Decision
Decision accepted.

==== Consequences
Development will start from scratch, but some ADRs from the previous project will be inherited. The previous project will be used as a reference for some functionalities and design decisions, and some of the code from the previous project might be used if found useful.

[[ADR-08]]
=== ADR 08: Use of Material UI component library
*_Date: 2025-03-10_*

image::mui.png["Material UI", align="center"]

==== Status
Accepted.

==== Context
Material UI (MUI) is a popular React component library that implements Google's Material Design guidelines. It provides a set of pre-built, customizable UI components—like buttons, forms, and layouts—that help developers build consistent, responsive, and visually appealing user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

As we wanted to use a component library that would allow us to create a clean and appealing user interface, we considered several options. MUI stood out as a strong candidate due to its popularity, ease of use, and extensive documentation.

==== Decision
Decision accepted.

==== Consequences
Material UI will be used in our project as the main component library for the user interface.
