== Architecture Constraints


This document describes the technical, organizational, and convention-based limitations that must be considered during the development of the WIChat project, 
an interactive web application for questions and answers based on images. 
The main objective of the project is to create a platform where users can participate in a quiz game based on different themes, guessing places or concepts from images.

A key feature of WIChat is the integration of a long language model (LLM) to provide players with conversational hints. 
Additionally, questions and answers are generated automatically using data from Wikidata. 
The following outlines the main constraints and conventions that will guide the development of the application.

=== Technical Limitations

[cols="e,2e", options="header"]
|===
| **Constraint** | **Explanation**

|*GIT & GitHub*
| The use of GIT will be mandatory for version control, and GitHub will be the platform we use to store the code. 
This system will allow parallel work by using branches for developing new features or fixing bugs. 
Additionally, we will use Pull Requests for code review before final integration.
GitHub Actions may be used to automate testing deployment.

|*Docker*
| Docker will be used to containerize the application in both development and production environments for web deployment, 
ensuring consistent environment configurations and simplifying application maintenance across different platforms.

|*MongoDB*
| MongoDB will be used as the primary database to store user data, questions, and hints.
Its flexible schema will allow efficient handling of dynamic content and scalability for future improvements.

|*React*
| The frontend will be developed using React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.  
This framework will enable a component-based architecture, improving maintainability and reusability.

|*Node.js*
| Execution environment using JavaScript for server-side operations, rather than client-side.  
It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient.

|*Express*
| Web framework for Node.js designed to simplify the implementation of web applications.  
It offers a minimal and flexible structure for handling routes, middleware, and API endpoints.

|*JavaScript*
| JavaScript will be the main programming language for both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js & Express),  
ensuring a unified development environment and reducing context switching between technologies.

|*Wikidata*
| Wikidata will be the primary source for generating images for the questions and hints.

|*LLMS (Long Language Model)*
| The system will use an external language model (LLM) to generate interactive hints about the images. 
However, due to the inherent limitations of LLMs (such as generating incorrect responses or hallucinations), 
it will be necessary to implement mechanisms to validate and mitigate these issues to ensure the accuracy of the generated hints.

=== Organizational Limitations
[cols="e,2e", options="header"]
|===
| **Constraint** | **Explanation**

|*Team*
| The project team consists of 6 people, which means that coordination and cooperation between team members is essential.

|*Time*
| The team must adhere to the established deadlines for project delivery, ensuring that progress is presented according to the anticipated dates and the decisions documented in the meeting minutes.

|*Meetings*
| Weekly meetings will be held during the practical classes, where the tasks completed by each team member during the previous week will be reviewed, and new tasks will be discussed. 
If there is a need to address questions outside these meetings, team members can ask through the WhatsApp group, or hold meetings via Discord, 
making sure that the decisions made during those sessions are clearly documented on GitHub.

|*Issues*
| The GitHub Issues tool will be used for task management. Each team member will be responsible for completing the tasks specified within the given time frame.

|*Records*
| After each meeting, whether during the scheduled practice hours or any extraordinary meetings, meeting minutes will be written to document the decisions made.

=== Convention Constraints
[cols="e,2e", options="header"]
|===
| **Constraint** | **Explanation**

|*Software Design*
| The code must be modular, maintainable, and understandable. "Clean code" principles will be applied to ensure the project is easy to update and expand.

|*Documentation*
| The Arc42 template will be used to create the project documentation. 
This documentation must be clear, structured, and easy to follow, with a practical approach so that any team member or external 
person can understand the architecture and key components of the system. 

|*Adaptability*
| The application must be designed to work across multiple devices and screen sizes, 
ensuring a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile platforms. 
Responsive design techniques and best practices will be implemented to optimize usability across different resolutions.

|*Usability*
| The system must provide an intuitive and accessible user interface, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.
