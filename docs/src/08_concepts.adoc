=== User experience

The app is designed as a quiz game that you have a variety of questions across different categories, each with multiple answer choices where only one is correct, the questions will focus on guessing a location based on a displayed photo. Additionally, users can request hints from a LLM, enhancing their learning experience while playing.

=== Usability

Usability is a critical factor for any application, as it directly influences how efficiently users can interact with it.
To ensure our appâ€™s usability, we will adhere to design standards and conduct testing with a diverse group of users, who will provide feedback on how intuitive the interface feels.

=== Security

Since we prioritize the security of user information, it is a key focus for our app.We will encrypt user passwords and limit the amount of data we collect from them. For LLM interactions we ensure that no personally identifiable information is shared with external services.

=== Testing

To ensure the app functions correctly, we have chosen to implement unit tests and conduct manual testing. Additionally, we will perform the usability tests mentioned earlier to further enhance the user experience.

=== Maintainability

We have committed to following best practices to ensure the app is easy to maintain and update. We aim to simplify future enhancements and ensure we can work efficiently.
