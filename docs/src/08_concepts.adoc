=== User experience

Our application is designed as an engaging quiz game. Players answer questions from a variety of categories, each with multiple 
choices and only one correct answer. The main challenge is to guess a location based on a displayed photo. To enhance learning and 
fun, users can request hints from a Large Language Model (LLM) at any time.

=== Usability

Usability is a critical factor for any application, as it directly influences how efficiently users can interact with it.
To ensure our appâ€™s usability, we will adhere to design standards and conduct testing with a diverse group of users, who will provide feedback on how intuitive the interface feels.

=== Security

Since we prioritize the security of user information, it is a key focus for our app.We will encrypt user passwords and limit the amount of data we collect from them. For LLM interactions we ensure that no personally identifiable information is shared with external services.

=== Testing

To ensure the app functions correctly, we have chosen to implement unit tests and conduct manual testing. Additionally, we will perform the usability tests mentioned earlier to further enhance the user experience.

=== Maintainability

We have committed to following best practices to ensure the app is easy to maintain and update. We aim to simplify future enhancements and ensure we can work efficiently.
