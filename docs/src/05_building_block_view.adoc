Motivation::

The goal of this system is to offer a question and answer game based on images, where participants can answer questions automatically generated from Wikidata. 
Additionally, a Large Language Model (LLM) provides hints to participants when requested, enhancing the game experience.

Contained Building Blocks::

|Name| Description

|User

|Represents the participants of the game (they can answer questions and request hints).

|Browser

|Interface where the user interacts with the game. It is responsible for sending answers and hint requests.

|WIChat
|Manages the game logic. It communicates with Wikidata to retrieve data and provides additional information to the LLM when necessary.

|Wikidata
|Database that provides the data to generate the questions.

|LLM (Large Language Model)
|Processes users' questions about the images and returns hints to the Browser to help the participants.

Important Interfaces::
|===
|Name| Description

|**User interface** (User ↔ Browser)
|The user interacts with the Browser. The Browser is used to send answers and requests hints.

|**HTTP/REST Inteface** (Browser ↔ WIChat)
|The browser communicates with de WIChat system using HTTP or REST requests to send answer and retrieve
game information

|**Hints Requests** (Browser ↔ LLM)
| The browser requests hints from the Large Language Model (LLM) to assist the participants.

|**Query for Additional Information** (LLM ↔ WIChat)
|The LLM queries WIChat when additional information is needed to provide hints.

|**REST Inteface** (WIChat ↔ Wikidata)
|WIChat interacts with Wikidata via REST requests to retrieve data for generating questions.

|**Response in HTML/JSON** (WIChat ↔ Browser)
|WIChat sends the processed information to the browser in HTML or JSON format to be presented to the user.

|**Sending Hints** (LLM ↔ Browser)
|The LLM sends hints to the browser to be displayed to the user.

Motivation::

The goal of this system (WIChat) is to offer a question and answer game based on images, where participants can answer questions automatically generated from Wikidata. 
Additionally, a Large Language Model (LLM) provides hints to participants when requested, enhancing the game experience.
The system also includes features for user management, group interactions and a math-based mini-game.

Contained Building Blocks::

|Name| Description

|*User*
|Represents the participants of the game. They can answer questions of the main game or the math mini-game, 
request hints, join groups and interacts with other users.

|*Browser*
|Interface (frontend) where the user interacts with the game. It sends request to the backend via the Gateway.

|*GatewayService*
|Acts as a central single entry point for frontend requests. 
It routes them to the appropriate backend service.

|*WikidataService*
|Handles the core game logic. It retrieves questions and answers from the external Wikidata repository
and process them for the game

|*Wikidata* (external)
|External semantic knowledge base. The WikidataService queries this to obtain data for generating questions.

|*LLM (Large Language Model)*
|Provides hints based on user requests. It may contact the WikidataService to obtaing context or clarigy game-related
data before responding

|*MathGame*
|A backend service that generate math-based questions and evaluates answer, providing an additional mini-game experience.

|*AuthService*
|Handles user authentication, including login and token generation.

|*UserService*
|Manages user data, including profile information, friend requests and private messages.

|*GroupService*
|Handles group-related functionalities, such as creating groups, adding users to groups, and managing group messages.

|*APIService*
|Provides a REST API for external integrations and serves as a bridge between the GatewayService and other services.

Important Interfaces::
|===
|Name| Description

|**User interface** (User ↔ Browser)
|The user interacts with the Browser to answer questions(for the main game or math mini-game), request hints, manage their profile and join or create groups.

|**Frontend to Backend Gateway** (Browser ↔ GatewayService)
|The Browser sends all requests (game logic, hints, user info, etc.) to the `GatewayService` using HTTP/REST. 
The Gateway routes these request to the appropriate backend services.

|**Game Logic** (GatewayService ↔ WikidataService)
|Routes game-related request (e.g., get question, submit answer) from the frontend to the `WikidataService`.

|**Wikidata Query Interface** (WikidataService ↔ Wikidata)
|The `WikidataService` comunicates with the public Wikidata knowledge base to retrieve data for generating questions.

|**Hints Requests** (Gateway ↔ LLMService)
|Routes hint request to the `LLMService`, which enrich response by querying `WikidataService`

|**Math Game** (GatewayService ↔ MathGame)
|Routes math-game specific request (new question, validate answer) to the `MathGame` service.

|**Authentication** (GatewayService ↔ AuthService)
|Handles login and authentication logic via secure requests through the Gateway.

|**User Management** (GatewayService ↔ UserService)
|Routes requests for user profiles, friendships, and messages to the `UserService`.

|**Group Management** (GatewayService ↔ GroupService)
|Routes group-related operations (create group, join, chat) to the `GroupService`.

|**External API Interface** (APIService ↔ External Systems)
|Allows external clients to consume parts of the system’s functionality securely.
