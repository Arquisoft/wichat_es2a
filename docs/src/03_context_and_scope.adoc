The business context defines how WIChat interacts with its key stakeholders and systems in terms of domain-specific inputs and outputs. This includes:

- **Users (Contestants)**: Players who interact with the system to answer questions and request hints.
- **System Administrator**: Responsible for managing and monitoring the platform.
- **Language Model (LLM)**: Provides AI-generated hints based on user inputs.
- **Wikidata**: Supplies the data and images used to generate questions.

**Technical Context Table**

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Communication Partner | Channel/Protocol | Input/Output
| Users (Contestants)   | HTTP (Web Browser) | Game interactions, hint requests, and responses
| System Administrator  | HTTP (Admin Panel) | Platform management commands and logs
| Language Model (LLM)  | API (REST/GraphQL) | Image/question data and hint generation
| Wikidata              | API (SPARQL)      | Data queries and responses
|===

The technical context describes the channels and protocols used by WIChat to communicate with its external systems and users. Key aspects include:

- **HTTP**: Used for communication between users, administrators, and the system.
- **Data Flow**: How inputs and outputs are mapped to specific channels for seamless operation.

**Mapping Input/Output to Channels**

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Input/Output | Channel/Protocol | Communication Partner
| Game responses, hint requests | HTTP | Users (Contestants)
| Platform management commands | HTTP | System Administrator
| Image/question data, hint generation | API | Language Model (LLM)
| Data queries and responses | API | Wikidata
|===

This mapping clarifies how specific inputs and outputs are transmitted through the system:

- **Users**: Interact via HTTP to send and receive game-related data.
- **Administrators**: Use HTTP to manage the platform and access logs.
- **LLM and Wikidata**: Communicate via APIs to process data and generate hints or questions.
