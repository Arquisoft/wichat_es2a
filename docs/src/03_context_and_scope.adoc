== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

**Business Context Table**

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Communication Partner | Inputs | Outputs
| Users (Contestants)   | Registration data, game responses, hint requests | Game questions, AI-generated hints, game history
| System Administrator  | Platform management commands | System status reports, user activity logs
| Language Model (LLM)  | Image and question data | Interactive hints
| Wikidata              | Data queries | Images and question-related data
|===

The business context defines how WIChat interacts with its key stakeholders and systems in terms of domain-specific inputs and outputs. This includes:

- **Users (Contestants)**: Players who interact with the system to answer questions and request hints.
- **System Administrator**: Responsible for managing and monitoring the platform.
- **Language Model (LLM)**: Provides AI-generated hints based on user inputs.
- **Wikidata**: Supplies the data and images used to generate questions.

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

**Technical Context Table**

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Communication Partner | Channel/Protocol | Input/Output
| Users (Contestants)   | HTTPS (Web Browser) | Game interactions, hint requests, and responses
| System Administrator  | HTTPS (Admin Panel) | Platform management commands and logs
| Language Model (LLM)  | API (REST/GraphQL) | Image/question data and hint generation
| Wikidata              | API (SPARQL)      | Data queries and responses
|===

The technical context describes the channels and protocols used by WIChat to communicate with its external systems and users. Key aspects include:

- **HTTPS**: Used for secure communication between users, administrators, and the system.
- **Data Flow**: How inputs and outputs are mapped to specific channels for seamless operation.

**Mapping Input/Output to Channels**

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Input/Output | Channel/Protocol | Communication Partner
| Game responses, hint requests | HTTPS | Users (Contestants)
| Platform management commands | HTTPS | System Administrator
| Image/question data, hint generation | API | Language Model (LLM)
| Data queries and responses | API | Wikidata
|===

This mapping clarifies how specific inputs and outputs are transmitted through the system:

- **Users**: Interact via HTTPS to send and receive game-related data.
- **Administrators**: Use HTTPS to manage the platform and access logs.
- **LLM and Wikidata**: Communicate via APIs to process data and generate hints or questions.
