****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and

WIChat is a course project for the subject of Software Architecture of the Software Engineering Degree at the University of Oviedo. It is developed by the team composed of this students:

* Natalia Blanco Agudín
* David Covián Gómez
* Darío Cristóbal González
* Hugo Fernández Rodríguez
* Marcos Llanos Vega
* Hugo Prendes Menéndez

This project consists of the design and implementation of a web application consisting of a quiz game, similar to the quiz show “Saber y ganar”, broadcasted continuously by TVE since 1997 and presented by Jordi Hurtado.

The game will consist of the user having to guess the location of a photo shown by the application, as well as answer questions related to it. However, he will not be alone in this task, since he will have the help of a chat that will give him clues. Behind this chat, an LLM will be hidden, which will be in charge of generating these clues.

The objective of this game will be to expand the users' knowledge and memory, while they have a good time. In the meantime, its main functionalities will be:

* Question and answer generation
* Implementation of a chat to give clues
* User registration and their previous results


=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

The main objective of this project is the development of a new web application that allows users to play a quiz game based on a picture of a place, while having a chat that uses a LLM to give them clues.

The application will have the following functionalities:

* A web frontend that will display the images of the game along with the question and its possible answers, which must be answered in a given time.
* Both images and answers will be generated from Wikidata data and will be accessible through an API.
* A chat using an LLM to give hints to users.
* User registration system to save their previous results, which will be accessible through an API.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****
endif::arc42help[]


The following table describes the project quality goals.

|=== 
| Quality Goal | Motivation

| *Efficiency*
| The game should run quickly and smoothly, so as not to bore the user with unnecessary waiting.

| *Usability*
| The application must be easy to learn and use, because no one will stop to read an instruction manual.

| *Maintenance*
| The application must be designed in such a way that parts can be modified in the future without the need to redo the application.

| *Testability*.
| Different use cases should be tested to ensure correct operation.

| *Security*
| The application should be secure enough so that no one can access a user's personal information without permission.

|=== 


=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
